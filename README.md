# NotSimpleGame 🎮

A 2D RPG game built from scratch in C++ as a learning project focused on game architecture and systems design.

## 🚀 About

NotSimpleGame is a from-scratch 2D RPG where I'm learning advanced C++ concepts, game architecture patterns, and project structure management. The project emphasizes clean code organization and scalable system design.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **Graphics:** SFML
- **GUI:** TGUI
